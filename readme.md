# SEI04 Project Two Crud App (Portfolio Site)

## Idea
For my project I wanted to create a web app similar to Behance or Dribble. I wanted to allow users to be able to upload a project and for the public to see. The public could be able to see the project in more detail by clicking on a post and see more about the creator by doing the same.

## Wireframes 
This was the very first wireframe I did created using Adobe XD. It was a simple grid layout of users projects and a global nav at the top.

My actual design is slightly different to how I wanted it and when I have time I would like to change the design to how I invisioned it.


## How to use
You create a account using the sign in option
Login
Upload projects using the upload feature
You can view your dashboard if you hover over the avatar. From there you can edit/delete any projects.
